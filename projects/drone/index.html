          <h2>We made <span class="red">it!</span></h2>
          <p>
            Our start was not very interesting, but through the years of work we
            had a lot of exciting periods. We started as a small company in 1950
            and in just a few years we started working on large UAV aircraft for
            military purposes. The first aircraft was built in 1956 and is the
            forerunner of today's drones. Until the 2000s, we worked exclusively
            with UAVs, but with the advancement of technology, the direction of
            the company's work changed and already in 2002, the drone was under
            construction very similar to today's. In just the next few years,
            the improvements have been huge and the latest model can in no way
            be compared to the original one.
          </p>
          <img src="assests/image/defence_drones.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            We are market leaders because our drones are specially tailored for
            a variety of uses. Although we started with drones exclusively for
            military use, today we have only 20% of production for that purpose.
            The best-selling ones are for personal use, most often for
            photographing and filming space, but we cannot ignore the high
            carrying capacity and durability of aircraft and their use in rescue
            missions or simply in ordinary deliveries. We write history, but you
            are responsible for that!

              <h3>Do I need a permit to fly a drone?</h3>
              <p>
                In most country a so-called Ascent Permit is required for
                commercial use of unmanned microcopters (drone). This is issued
                either individually or generally by the respective states and is
                valid for several years. We have compiled all the necessary
                information and local contacts for our customers to easily
                obtain the permit, and will be provided to you after purchasing
                a Height-Tech multicopter.

              <h3>How much can a drone carry?</h3>
              <p>
                The net load of our strongest drone is currently up to 2,400 g.
                This includes the weight of the respective camera mount. We
                generally recommend keeping the net load as low as possible to
                be able to reach long flight times when needed. For example,
                current system cameras can achieve close to the video quality of
                full format cameras, even surpassing them, with only 50% of its
                weight.

              <h3>How high and far can drones fly?</h3>
              <p>
                The range of the drone control is about 1.5 km. Export systems
                can achieve a range of up to 50 km. In the field our larger
                drones can therefore operate at a perimeter and altitude of
                about 200m. When using the drone in the mountains the limits are
                set by the low atmospheric pressure. However, our drones have
                already been successfully used at 3,950 m above sea level.

              <h3>Can drones also be used indoors?</h3>
              <p>
                The emission-free and silent electric drives of course also
                allow our drones to be used indoors. Applications are e.g. demo
                flights at trade fairs or film shots inside buildings. Due to
                the typically limited space a suitable launch and landing site
                not accessible by onlookers must be provided. Since the GPS and
                compass sensor technology limited inside buildings, the pilot
                must be able to control the drone manually.

              <h3>Which drive technology use?</h3>
              <p>
                Our drones are propelled by electricity. We use state-of-the-art
                external rotor motors which change their speed several hundred
                times a second. Using external rotor motors allows for
                propellers to be directly propelled without a loud and heavy
                drive. These propellers with low speeds are required for the
                high efficiency. We use the latest lithium polymer battery
                technology to guarantee the best possible power.

              <h3>What if drone crashes?</h3>
              <p>
                After sending the drone to use we will review the data of the
                flight data recorder. We will simultaneously create a damage
                analysis. The damage will then be repaired as quickly as
                possible. Since we typically have all spare parts in stock, your
                drone will usually be returned within a few days. If you ordered
                the “First Class Package”, you will promptly receive a
                replacement drone free of charge.
