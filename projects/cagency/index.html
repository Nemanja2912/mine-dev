          <h3>This is why you need to come and visit Belgrade</h3>
          <p>
            One of the oldest cities in Europe and the only one built on the
            confluence of two rivers, Belgrade is the city that never sleeps and
            the symbol of great nightlife. The capital of Serbia, Belgrade, is
            known as “the city that never sleeps”. Floating clubs on its rivers
            have become synonyms for great parties and neverending fun, and
            Skadarlija, the bohemian street, for a place where music and singing
            can be heard until dawn. And yet, Belgrade is one of the oldest
            cities in Europe. This “white city” is the only capital built at the
            confluence of two big rivers – the Danube and the Sava. Belgrade is
            a modern european city with population of about 1.7 million people.
            It is an administrative, political and cultural center of the
            country.

          The cornerstone for the building at Nikola Pasic Square, today's National Assembly, was placed on August 27th, 1907, in the presence of King Petar I Karadjordjevic. It was built on the location of the biggest Turkish Batal Mosque which was demolished right after Serbia gained independence in 1878 and was no longer under the Turkish reign.
          
          The National Assembly was built near today's Tasmajdan Park, where Hatiserif (the Sultan’s edict) was read on November 1830 that brought liberation for the people of Serbia and Milos Obrenovic became hereditary prince of the Serbian state.
          
          The first project of the future House of Representative was made by the architect Konstantin Jovanović in 1892. His plan was later changed for technical reasons, because of a new state constitution which required a bicameral instead of the unicameral legislature. On the repeated competition architect Jovan Ilkić won, and the construction of the National Assembly had started."

It is home to several galleries and museums, restaurants, sports courts, and the Belgrade Zoo.
          Besides many kilometers of paths and numerous hideouts through the park, there’s also a few playgrounds for the kids, some chess boards from the elderly, and a great wall which is a favorite spot for teens & youth with spectacular and often romantic views of sunsets, storms or other beauties of nature. In winter, the younger population goes skiing and sleigh riding on the slopes near the Zoo, or ice-skating at the court near the Sahat (Clock) tower.
          The park is also home to squirrels and other smaller animals which from time to time like to hang around with people, specially if you have some food to offer them.

The church, dedicated to Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, was built between the two world wars, beginning in 1931, and completed in 1940. The original church was in a graveyard and its benefactor was a merchant Lazar Panca. Here are buried Mlan Obrenovic (the eldest son of Milos Obrenovic) and the couple King Alexander I Obrenovic and his wife, queen Draga. On the place where the church stands today in 1830 was read the sultans’ edict which announced Serbian autonomy within Turkey. During the German bombing of Belgrade, April 13 th 1941, the old building was damaged, so in 1942 the remainings of the church were removed. Because of the rapid growth of the city and the increase in the number of residents, it became necessary by the beginning of the twentieth century to build a bigger church in the Belgrade quarter of Palilula. In 1930 brothers Petar and Branko Krstic (professors at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade) completed the design for project of a new church building. The construction was postponed due to WW 2. After war, November 14th 1948 the Church was consecrated (by Patriarch Gavrilo Dožić) and the church opened for divine service."

On a sunny day the views stretch up to 100 kilometers offering breathtaking panoramas of the city, the surrounding hills, towns, roads and rivers, as well as to the Pannonian plain in the north. The Avala Tower was a symbol of pride and a famous landmark, not only of Belgrade and Serbia, but of the former Yugoslavia too. History
          The tower was designed by architects Uglješa Bogdanović and Slobodan Janjić, and engineer Milan Krstić. Construction started on 14 October 1961 and was completed four years later in 1965. The tower weighed 4,000 tons. It was the only tower in the world to have an equilateral triangle as its cross section, and one of very few towers not perched directly into the ground, but standing on its legs. The legs formed a tripod, the symbol of Serbian tripod chair. It is one of the small number of towers to be constructed in that manner."

            landDesc="The Automobile Museum, Bratislav Petkovic Collection, is the newest in a series of technical museums in Serbia. The Museum was founded by the Assembly of the City of Belgrade and Bratislav Petkovic, the collector and owner of a collection comprising historically valuable cars and arhive material on the domestic history of motoring. The Museum’s premises are situated in the Modern Garage, a characteristic monument of the technical culture of its age, itself declared a cultural asset. The building, designed by the Russian arhitect Valerij Staševski, was built in the city centre in 1929 as the first public garage. It housed the automobiles of the participants in the first international car and motorcycle race ever held in Belgrade, on September 3, 1939. By transforming the Modern Garage into the Automobile Museum one of the foremost principles of the cultural heritage protection has been satisfied: to use a monument only for a purpose close to the original one. An ideal totally has thus been created, bearing cultural, technical and historical relevance. "
